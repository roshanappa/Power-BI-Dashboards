# Power-BI-Dashboards
Here I am putting the dashboard that I have been created while practicing that gives so good enthusiasm analytics with DAX formulas and business understanding.

I have use DAX of the Sales related domain like Sales

Gross profit,Total Sales,Total Cost,% Gross Profit and understand customer relationship with different attriutes like state,values and their wealth segmentation for analysing bike purchase related information and compare the with KPI of sales with the Total sales.

Create the customer behaviour and understand what they prefer and how the Sales is going on and at what kind attributes sales are getting impacted so that we can take action by understanding the root cause.

In the Transaction of customer how the sales going foreward and understand what are parameter are returning the high profit and will organize the Strategy accordingly.

I use the waterflowchart,filter,lineplot,barplot,histogram,maps,DonutChart and some drill down according our requirement.
